## groOvy app

groOvy is an app where users are able to share their what they are currently listening to so that other users can be able to see the different types of music everyone is listening to. 

Users are able to view everyone's grooves in a feed and have the ability to comment on everyone's post. Any post that the user makes, can be edited and/or deleted by only by that user.

Users also have access to their own feed where they can see ONLY their own posts.

Let the groOvy sharing begin.
